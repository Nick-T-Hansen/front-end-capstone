You can view a GIF of my demo on my site at https://nick-t-hansen.github.io/

Cave is my first simple CRUD application using React. Cave originated as a way for me to organize my personal camping gear. The application allows a user to:
1. Catalogue your camping gear with basic details.
2. Determine which gear they would want to share with other people using the application and allow them to view the gear and request to use it.
3. Keep track of the borrowed camping gear a user has to be able to return it back to their owner.

## Getting Started
The Cave application utilizes React, React-Router-Dom, and Bootstrap.
1. clone repo using `git clone https://github.com/Nick-T-Hansen/front-end-capstone.git`
1. run `npm install` to pull in dependencies
1. run the JSON server at `json-server -p 5002 -w database.json` ( `npm install -g json-server` if necessary )
5. `npm start` in root directory to start react server
6. create a new account and login

## Version II Aspirations
1. Given a user wants to find a certain item
    When the user searches in the community section through a search bar
    Then all items relevant to the search are filtered and displayed

1. Given a user wants to know who has their stuff
    When a user clicks on a button on their homepage
    then their borrowed gear is displayed showing the name of the item
    and who is currently borrowing it
